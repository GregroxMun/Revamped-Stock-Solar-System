}

//	StockJoolMoonSizes: Resizes Laythe, Vall, and Tylo back to their original stock size. Default is False.
//  StockJoolMass: Resizes Jool to its stock size, and lowers its surface gravity to stock as well. Default is False.
//  StockJoolOrbits: Moves the main three moons of Jool back to their original stock orbits. Default is False.
//  StockMinorMoonOrbits: Moves the irregular outer moons of Jool back in. Pol and Bop are in their stock orbits, and Gobe has been moved into an orbit which matches. Default is False.
//	FurtherAmeli: Moves Ameli to a further out orbit. This is soley to avoid an instant game crash with Principia. Default is False.
//  AlteredJoolMoonNames: Serves as a reminder to both you and anyone else that the moons of Jool are different from before. Names are Laith, Vol, and Tilow. Default is False.
//	NoJoolOxygen: Removes the oxygen from Jool's atmosphere.
//
//	MinmusComet: Moves Minmus to the orbit of 67P Churyomov-Geraseminko. Default is False.
//	MinmusTrojan: Moves Minmus to an orbit identical to Kerbin's, except 30 degrees behind. Default is False.
//	StockMunMinmusOrbits: Moved Mun and Minmus to their stock orbits. Obviously. Default is False.
//	RetroMinmus: Taking a bit of the wisdom of the RetroBop of Principia plugin, Minmus is put in its distant RevSS orbit, but in a retrograde orbit. Default is False.
//
//  RemoveExtraBodies: Removes Gobe, Kev, and Ameli from the game, as well as any other bodies added by Revamped Stock System. Default is False.
//                     Don't worry, it won't remove anything other than RevSS bodies!
//  BrighterMun: Makes Mun brighter in scaledspace, but not in localspace. Default is False.
