			description = The Sun is a relatively normal yellow main sequence star. It was long thought to be a huge burning mass of coal in the sky, burning an unending supply of the flammable rocks. It is now known that the Sun, and all main sequence stars like it, do not burn fuel as much as they totally annihilate it through a process known as Nuclear Fusion.
