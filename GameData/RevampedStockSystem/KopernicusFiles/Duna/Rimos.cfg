			description = Rimos is Duna's smallest moon. During an opposition of Duna many years ago, one Asaph Kerman was spending many long nights at the Kerbal Naval Observatory. A low level intern noticed, and assumed that he was looking for moons. The intern decided he would hang out with Hall and become a co-discoverer. Asaph did not enjoy his company, nor his intentions, at all. There was to be a party of politicians one night, and of course everyone who was anyone had to be there. The intern went. Asaph didn't. During his one free night of particularly good weather, he had marked off the discovery of a moon by the next day. Rimos is named after the Kerbal god of the third wheel.
