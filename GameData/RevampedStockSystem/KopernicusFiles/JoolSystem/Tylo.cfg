			description = Tylo was the first moon of Jool to be discovered. It offered definite proof that Kerbin was not the center of the universe. If a celestial body was orbiting Jool, it certainly wasn't orbiting Kerbin! When this news was first made public, the discoverer of Tylo was called a heretic and a munatic. Of course it had to be fake! However, when other astronomers found corroborating evidence, his ideas slowly became more accepted. Tylo is a very white moon, and a very large one. Strangely, it seems to have nothing more than a very tenuous atmosphere, despite its high gravity. Its white surface is thought to be made from stones, ices, and even clay. Unlike the other two moons of Jool, this moon appears to be geologically dead.
