	//"Fixed" the MapDecal thanks to Sigma88
	//We take the export of the mapDecal, the export without the mapDecal, both of which without the crater colors.
	//Then we photoshop the good mapDecal onto the mapDecal-less one.
	//Then use that as the color map
	//Then export the planet texture again with the crater colors.
	//Then use that as the scaledspace texture.

			description = Bop is a small moon of Jool. It is one of the distant irregular satellites of Jool, orbiting among Pol and Gobe. Its dark color kept it from being discovered for quite some time, and was only discovered after an astronomer took a photograph of Jool with an un-accounted for spot on the southern cloud bands. After following the trajectory of the object, he was able to find that the object was in fact a moon. The mysterious black object was named for the mischevious owner of the mythical Kraken, a beast which was said to attack boats at sea without warning. Bop is much denser than the other outer moons of Jool, and is thought to be made out of similar compositions to the regular inner satellites. As such, it is thought to be an inner satellite that was thrown out by Laythe or Tylo. Bop is also quite large. With a radius larger than that of Minmus, Bop is the smallest moon orbiting Jool that is large enough to be spherical due to its own gravity.
