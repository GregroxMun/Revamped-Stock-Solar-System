			description = Pol is a very unique object orbiting Jool. Its comparatively low density suggests that it is a rubble pile, a bundle of rocks that happen to be flying in the same orbit, held together by what is probably fair to say is only partly gravity. Before it was discovered, it often confused astronomers who thought they were looking at Gobe. It was only after one astronomer realized that they could see two Gobes together that she realized that this must be a separate object. Its surface is a strange muddle of yellows, browns, all in a very confusing and mysterious unknown composition. No one has ever been able to figure out for certain what the darned surface is made of. Three separate studies returned totally different planet-wide surface compositions, ranging from stony to icy to organic composition. The only way to tell for sure what the darned surface is made from would be to retrieve a sample directly.
