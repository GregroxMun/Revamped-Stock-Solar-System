			description = Vall is a medium-sized moon orbiting Jool. It is covered in blueish ices and stone. It is right between the larger Laythe and Tylo, which squeeze on Vall to produce cryovolcanism and interesting tectonic activity. In spite of these interesting properties, one of the staff members Spaceflight Planning Office continually insists that they must "attempt no landings there", which persisted until he realized nobody was paying any attention to him.
