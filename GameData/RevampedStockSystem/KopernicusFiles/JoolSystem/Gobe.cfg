			description = Gobe is a small irregular moon orbiting Jool. It is a relatively dark and dull moon. Spectral analysis suggests that it is probably a carbon-rich captured asteroid that formed in the asteroid belt which Dres currently dominates. When it was first discovered, the scientist in charge did not enter it in the record books because he was not sure if any object like Gobe could possibly have formed or migrated into such a distant orbit. He had to spend years of calculation before he managed to prove that, in fact, Gobe could not possibly exist in the orbit he had observed. Around the same time, another astronomer managed to conclusively prove that Gobe would definitely have managed to become captured there. The problem arose because the former scientist was confusing Gobe for another moon, Pol. That mistake would go unexplained for half a century.
