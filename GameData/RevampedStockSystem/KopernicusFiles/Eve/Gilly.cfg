			description = Gilly is a small brown rock that is occasionally seen wandering around the orbit of Eve. It was only discovered fairly recently due to its small size, low reflectiveness, and the fact that for half of the year only its night side could be seen. The other half of the year, Eve was in the same part of the sky as the Sun, making observations even more difficult. When it finally was discovered, the astronomer was very nearly blind due to repeated direct exposure to the sun. How he managed to find it with damaged retinas is unknown, but nonetheless he knew about it before anyone else did.
