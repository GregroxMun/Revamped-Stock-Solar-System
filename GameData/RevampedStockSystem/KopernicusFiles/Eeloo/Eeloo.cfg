			description = Eeloo is a small, dirty snow-ball on the edge of the solar system. When Eeloo was first discovered, the Kerbal Astronomical Union classified it as a planet for several years. It occupies an orbit which is in a mean motion resonance with Jool, meaning that it goes around two times for every three times Jool goes around. Some astronomers have proposed that Eeloo may once have been a moon of Jool that got kicked out during its early formation. It is made from ice and dirt and is expected to potentially harbor a thin atmosphere. After it was found that Eeloo was smaller and smaller than expected, and that there may be lots more objects like it, they had to reconsider whether or not it really should be called a planet or not. While the majority of the scientific community agreed that it should be classified as a dwarf, the very vocal public were all very angry at the idea of demoting "Poor Eeloo," because it seems they had kerbthropomorphized it and made it seem like it was something other than a non-living hunk of ice. In the end, the Kerbal Astronomical Union reclassifed Eeloo as a dwarf planet. This is a decision that has made a lot of people unhappy and has been widely regarded as a "bad move."
