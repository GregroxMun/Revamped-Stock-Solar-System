			description = Dres is the smallest dwarf planet in the Solar System. It took a long time to discover because for most of its orbit it was not where planets usually orbit. The dwarf planet is dark grey with a few spots dotting its lumpy surface. It was notorious among astronomy students and professors alike for being "The most boring thing in the entire sky." Indeed, the Kerbal Astronomical Union came to the same conclusion, and hastily reclassified the planet as a dwarf.
