			@description = Eeloo is the most massive dwarf planet in the Trans-Neidonian object belt. It was not discovered until recently, however, because no one was looking for another dwarf planet like Plock. It is a lighter brown in color than Plock, and is thought to be made from materials more similar to the Neidonian moons than Plock.

			@description = Discovered at the same time as Plock, the square heads in charge of cataloging the astronomical discoveries mixed up the records of two celestial bodies, leading to years of one being confused for the other. The surface of Encethies is covered in brown scratches, which could be the result of cryovolcanic activity. This might mean that the moons harbors a liquid ocean beneath its frozen crust.
